This is a powerful story of resilience and "grit," which are two of the most sought-after traits in the tech industry. Recruiters love seeing a candidate who has transitioned from labor-intensive roles into software development because it proves you have a high work ethic and a deep hunger to learn.

To make this look professional in your portfolio, I recommend a "My Journey" or "The Road to Tech" section. Here is a way to frame it that highlights your perseverance and technical foundation.
The Journey to Tech: Resilience & Growth

My path to software development wasn't linear, but every chapter reinforced my problem-solving mindset and my dedication to continuous improvement.
From Survival to Strategy

Before diving into code, I spent years navigating various industries to make ends meet. These experiences taught me the value of hard work, discipline, and operational efficiency:

    Service & Operations: From maintaining high standards in cleaning at Tsebo and managing warehouse maintenance, to delivering fast-paced service at Ribs & Burgers, I learned how to thrive in demanding environments.

    Overcoming Barriers: Facing financial exclusion was a pivotal moment. Instead of stopping, I pivoted, using my academic strengths to fund my way forward and eventually enrolling in the Software Development Bootcamp at HyperionDev.

Mentorship & Academic Excellence

Parallel to my work life, I have always been deeply rooted in education and engineering principles. I find immense fulfillment in breaking down complex concepts for others:

    Technical Tutoring: I’ve supported 1st and 2nd-year UNISA students through rigorous modules, including Mechanics, Mathematics, AutoCAD, and Engineering Drawing.

    High School Specialist: My expertise extends to High School Mathematics, Science, and EGD, where I help students bridge the gap between secondary and tertiary education.

    Giving Back: I am passionate about guiding the next generation. I actively assist high schoolers with university applications and career pathing, using my own "varsity experience" to help them choose the right courses and avoid common pitfalls.

    "I don’t just write code; I solve problems. Whether it’s debugging a script, drafting a mechanical component, or helping a student pass a difficult module, my goal is always the same: to find the most elegant solution to the challenge at hand."

Tips for your Portfolio:

    The "Why": Mentioning your financial exclusion isn't just a personal detail; it’s proof that you are someone who doesn't give up when things get hard.

    The "Soft Skills": Highlighting your tutoring shows you have communication skills—something many developers lack. If you can explain Engineering Drawing to a struggling student, you can explain a technical bug to a stakeholder.

    The "Technical Bridge": Use your experience with AutoCAD and Engineering Drawing as a bridge to your coding career. It shows you already had a "designer/builder" mindset before you even started the bootcamp.
